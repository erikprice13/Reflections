When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Keeping all your work local is dangerous if not backed up, being vulnerable to crashes. Also 
having a remote repository can make sure that there is a completely up to date version where 
anyone working on the project can access it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to keep a note file that is just for github, or to not have a certain change 
made by another contributor show up in your own repository yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?

Forks you use for git to git cloning. Cloning you use to copy a repository and all its commit 
history. Branching you use to create an offshoot from the master branch to make changes not 
in the master copy itself.
