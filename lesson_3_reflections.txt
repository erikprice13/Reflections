When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Keeping all your work local is dangerous if not backed up, being vulnerable to crashes. Also 
having a remote repository can make sure that there is a completely up to date version where 
anyone working on the project can access it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to keep a note file that is just for github, or to not have a certain change made by another contributor show up in your own repository yet.
