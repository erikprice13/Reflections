What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you create a place to store and track your files. You would 
need this to be able to have good version-control using git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

The staging area in git is a pre-commit area that is where you can set up what you wish to 
commit from the working directory into the more permenent repository. This allows you to make 
changes before you commit if you decide you do not wish to commit everything in the working 
directory at once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You are able to use the staging area to commit once per logical change by adding only what 
you need to the stagin area and then commiting. Do this multiple times for multiple changes.
